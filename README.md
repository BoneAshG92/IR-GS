## Abstract
Infrared imaging extends the applicability of 3D reconstruction technologies, particularly in challenging scenarios like nighttime or dense smoke environments. However, transferring existing RGB algorithms to infrared data faces challenges due to geometric misalignment, weak texture characteristics, and sensor noise. We propose IR-GS, an infrared 3D Gaussian Splatting algorithm that addresses these issues through cross-modal geometric consistency and physics-aware uncertainty modeling. Our approach employs a two-stage alignment strategy based on structural phase congruency for sub-pixel cross-modal registration, introduces the Stefan-Boltzmann Law for physically consistent surface reconstruction, and incorporates an uncertainty-aware optimization mechanism to suppress noise interference. Experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in thermal radiation reconstruction accuracy, with an average PSNR increase of 18.04 dB, validating the robustness and precision of our algorithm. To enhance the transparency and reproducibility of our work, the source code and datasets are available at: https://github.com/BoneAshG92/IR-GS.git
